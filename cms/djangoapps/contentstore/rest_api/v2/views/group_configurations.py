    """
    The group configurations of one course, in the order Studio shows them.

    The configurations Studio lists on its group configurations page come
    first: the enrollment track configuration when the course has more than
    one track, the content type gating configuration when Studio may set it,
    then content groups and the rest. A course without content groups lists an
    unsaved content group configuration in their place, as Studio does, so
    that groups can be added to it; its identifier is chosen afresh for each
    request until then. Experiment configurations follow when the course has
    content experiments turned on, and are left out otherwise. Flags that
    describe the course rather than its group configurations, such as whether
    content experiments are turned on, are not part of this resource.

    By default (``view=minimal``) where each configuration and group is used
    in the course content is left out of the response; ``view=full`` includes
    it. Each configuration says whether the caller may change the course's
    group configurations.

    Anyone who may view the course's group configurations may list them. The
    course is looked up first, so a signed-in caller learns that a course does
    not exist (404) before being refused (403). An action this viewset was not
    written for is refused with a server error instead of being served with
    these checks.

    A plain ``ViewSet``: the configurations are user partitions stored with
    the course in the modulestore, not database rows.
